# R Visualization

This workshop focuses on `ggplot2` for making plots in R.  The workshop also briefly covers `plotly`.  

This workshop also makes use of other `tidyverse` packages for data manipulation and transformation.

# Note

The workshop materials use data on baby names from the Social Security Administration.  The data includes a sex variable.  The workshop materials try to stick to "sex" as used in the original data.  If we've slipped up and confused sex and gender, or you have suggestions for how we might better deal with sex and gender in an inclusive way, please [let us know](mailto:christina.maimone@northwestern.edu).

## Books

[`ggplot2` Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](http://ggplot2.org/book/) by Hadley Wickam, who wrote the package.  The book can also be downloaded as a pdf by going through the Library.  The book's code is [here](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book).

[R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/): free online book using the `tidyverse` of packages, has a chapter on [data visualization](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html).  It includes a chapter on [Graphics for communication](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html) which doesn't teach `ggplot` so much as give you good principles of making charts with it.

## Base R Graphics

A comparison on Base graphics and ggplot from [Flowing Data](http://flowingdata.com/2016/03/22/comparing-ggplot2-and-r-base-graphics/), which is a great site in general for R graphics, but he doesn't use `ggplot`.
